Of course!  
Here’s an **introduction** you can use for your **NetVulnX** project:

# 🌐 NetVulnX - Network Attack Simulation & Awareness Toolkit

**NetVulnX** is a powerful, educational toolkit designed to simulate various real-world network attacks in a controlled environment.  
It helps cybersecurity learners, ethical hackers, and researchers understand how different network vulnerabilities and attacks work —  
including **MITM attacks**, **rootkit awareness**, **DDoS attacks**, **DNS spoofing**, **phishing via Zphisher**, and **botnet-based attacks** like **UFONet**.

**Key Features:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Simulation** using Bettercap
- **Rootkit Detection Awareness** using RKHunter
- **DDoS Attack Simulation** (SYN, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, ICMP floods, Ping of Death, Slowloris)
- **DNS Spoofing** with Ettercap GUI
- **Phishing Attacks** using Zphisher toolkit
- **Botnet Attack Simulation** via UFONet with Web GUI and Action Menus
- **Auto-Installation** of required tools and dependencies
- **Fixes compatibility issues** (example: auto-fixing UFONet's cgi import issue)

---

# 📚 Purpose
NetVulnX is developed purely for **educational**, **awareness**, and **ethical learning purposes**.  
It allows users to understand attack strategies and defense mechanisms — strengthening skills in network security, red teaming, penetration testing, and ethical hacking.

> 🛡️ **Warning**: Unauthorized use against real systems is illegal. Always use in lab environments or with full permission.

Got it!  
Here’s a clean and simple **"How to Install"** section you can add for your **NetVulnX** project:

---

# ⚙️ How to Install NetVulnX

1. **Update your system:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

2. **Install Git if not installed:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install git -y
   ```

3. **Clone the NetVulnX repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/NetVulnX.git
   ```

4. **Navigate into the NetVulnX directory:**
   ```bash
   cd NetVulnX
   ```

5. **Give execution permission:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x NetVulnX.py
   ```

6. **Run NetVulnX:**
   ```Python3
   Python3 NetVulnX.py
   ```

---

# 📦 Requirements
NetVulnX will automatically install and fix everything needed, but if you want to install manually:

- Python 3
- Pip3
- Bettercap
- Ettercap
- Metasploit
- Git
- UFONet dependencies (flask, requests, etc.)

You can install missing packages with:
```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip bettercap ettercap-text-only metasploit-framework -y
```

---

# 🚀 Usage
After installation, just select the attack type you want to simulate from the menu and follow the on-screen instructions.

---

> 🔥 Tip: Always run with **root privileges** (use `sudo python3 NetVulnX.py`) for better tool access and network control.
